## Our favorite species

**Greta:** My favorite species is the black bear because they can climb trees and they eat berries. You can see them camping in the woods and its alarming, but not as alarming as seeing a grizzly bear. They are so cute and I wish I could give one a hug but that would most likely go poorly.

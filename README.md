## Our favorite species

**Kennedie:** One of my favorite species is the regular garden snail! I have always liked them and starting from when I was a toddler, every time I saw a snail crossing a path I would move them over to the other side so they didn't get trampled. They're great!

**Greta:** My favorite species is the black bear because they can climb trees and they eat berries. You can see them camping in the woods and its alarming, but not as alarming as seeing a grizzly bear. They are so cute and I wish I could give one a hug but that would most likely go poorly.


**Kacie:** My favorite species at the moment are otters. They're intelligent, semi-tool users, adorable, have really cool sleeping behaviors, are keystone species, and have super-dense fur that make them waterproof! Also have been into red pandas lately. Both are all over my Instagram feed :)

**Elise** My favorite species are puffer fish. I remember swimming in the ocean in Mexico and putting my head under water to come face to face with one. I love how silly and square they look when not blown up. They are also the most poisonous fish in the see but I just want to go up and give them a little kiss on the head.
